Usage Examples
==============

There are two ways of using Freqgen: CLI and Python API. First, we'll look at
how to use the CLI and then how to use the (more complicated yet flexible)
Python API.

Generate an amino acid sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step of using Freqgen is to have an amino acid sequence. In the case
that you already have one, you can skip this step. If not, read on!

Freqgen has two ways of generating an amino acid sequence. The first is simply
to translate a DNA sequence::

    $ freqgen aa --mode=seq your_DNA_sequence_here.fasta
    INQTEL*

To exclude stop codons, use the ``-s`` flag::

    $ freqgen aa --mode=seq your_DNA_sequence_here.fasta -s
    INQTEL

To put the sequence into a formatted FASTA file, there's a ``-o`` flag::

    $ freqgen aa --mode=seq your_DNA_sequence_here.fasta -o output_sequence.fasta
    $ cat output_sequence.fasta
    >Generated by Freqgen from your_DNA_sequence_here.fasta
    INQTEL*
